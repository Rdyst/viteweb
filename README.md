# React/Vite

# How to install/Run React/Vite
You can either visit the [web](https://rdyst.github.io/viteweb/) or run it yourself <br/><br/>
Firstly download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and then download this repo in the case you want to run it <br /><br/>
Make a new folder and open it in your Visual Studio Code (or other editors) and open a terminal <br /><br/>
Run this command "npm create vite@latest" this is what i used (viteweb,React,javascript) follow the instructions that will show up after finishing this <br /><br/>
after running "npm run dev" you should see the link of the web and you are done ! <br/><br/>
If you want to run my repo then just download it and paste/replace it in your newly made vite-project.

# SASS/SCSS
